By MetaGame Industries, “Abyss World” has been developed over the last two years and received support from AMD, Epic Games & IGN.

In Abyss World, players embark on a journey through the vast world of Nordinia to uncover the secrets of the now-missing and mysterious “old tide.” As they explore the traces of this ancient phenomenon, they will encounter challenges and obstacles that will test their skills and ingenuity.

The souls of the world arrived on the other seashore with the “old tide.” But with the emergence of the “fire thief” incident, everything changed. The old tide disappeared, breaking the balance of order and causing the souls to be no longer attracted to the other shore. The strange tide sound and the spread of dark sea filth threatened to plunge the world into the abyss. But even in the face of such adversity, the Nordinians will not give up. They stand firm and fight to restore balance and order to their world.

As the ancient lighthouse on the mysterious island is lit, the power of this world will be awakened, revealing the secrets of the soul’s home and unlocking the mysteries of the Abyss World. This ancient beacon of light stands as a symbol of hope in the contaminated area, offering guidance and direction to those who seek it. Follow its light and join us on a journey of discovery as the story of the Abyss World unfolds.



The Shattered Lands are filled with soul fragments, each bursting with mysterious power. These fragments are scattered across the beaten path, waiting to be discovered by brave adventurers. Embark on exciting quests and adventures in the Shattered Lands to collect these fragments and harness their power to summon the heroic souls known as Heroes.


The Heroic Souls are a powerful force to be reckoned with. Each has unique abilities and origins, having been generals, archmages, or assassins in their former lives. As you collect these heroic souls and train them to fight against the dark forces of the Abyss, choose wisely. Each soul brings its unique strengths and abilities to the battlefield. Only by assembling a unit of the most powerful and balanced warriors will you be able to face the toughest challenges and emerge victorious in the depths of the Shattered Lands. Join us on this epic adventure and collect the Heroic Souls to become the ultimate warrior in the world of the Abyss.


In your Territory, you can improve the basic combat effectiveness and stats of your Heroes by crafting legendary equipment for them. This will require farming materials in the Shattered Lands, so be sure to explore and gather as much as you can.

As you and your fellow summoners explore the magnificent fantasy world that was once destroyed, you will have the opportunity to exchange resources and form your dream team of powerful warriors. Join us on this epic adventure and build your team of Heroes to become the ultimate force in the world of the Abyss.

‘Abyss World’ is a testament to the deep ardor that Joe and I hold for the gaming world.

Joe and I have been chasing our dream of creating our own game since 2018, but we underestimated the challenges that lay ahead.

As independent developers, we didn’t have the same financial resources as larger corporations, so we had to seek out game outsourcing services to support our entire team’s operations.

The real start of our journey began in 2020 when we began working on the game. We encountered countless detours and setbacks, from the combat system to gameplay design. We overturned countless plans and made continuous attempts and errors. It was a grueling process, and we poured our hearts and souls into it.

In order to create a successful ARPG game, it’s crucial to have a well-established brand and a significant amount of financial resources to devote to trial and error. The development process can take years and involves substantial risks. Unfortunately, for smaller studios, the creation of a full-fledged ARPG game can be a nearly insurmountable challenge.

It took us two long years to complete the game’s core combat system and system infrastructure, and we almost emptied our wallets in the process. But we refused to give up, and in 2023, we finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. We met people who believed in our vision and were willing to support us in the long run. It was a humbling and inspiring experience, and it taught us that with passion and perseverance, anything is possible.


Why Web3?
As a passionate player of games such as Dota, Darkness, God of War, and World of Warcraft, I understand firsthand the deep connection that players can develop with these virtual worlds. The devastating impact that server shutdowns, like the recent closure of the Blizzard server, can have on players is huge. When a server is shut down or data is deleted by the operators, it’s not just a game that’s being lost. For many players, their entire virtual existence is erased. All the hours, days, and weeks they spent building characters, exploring new worlds, and forging relationships with other players are wiped away. This can be an incredibly emotional experience, akin to losing a treasured possession or even a part of oneself.

But in the world of blockchain, time is perpetual. This means that everything I pay in the virtual world, no matter how long it takes or what I receive, will be preserved, especially the high-level achievement in the game. The remarkable innovation of blockchain technology has the potential to offer a beautiful solution to an important problem — that of preserving the digital journeys of players for as long as possible while ensuring that they are treated with the respect they deserve. This is already a new paradigm shift for players.

Nonetheless, what does it mean to combine blockchain and game economies?

It means creating a world where players are empowered to explore, create, and thrive. Though I’ve seen my fair share of NFT bubbles burst and P2E models collapse, I know that the future of blockchain games is not limited to these failed forms.

Rather than relying on simple JPEG images, we need to explore ways to generate real value in the virtual world, tapping into the player’s continuous demand for in-game goods.

I believe that the player’s demand for in-game goods is continuous. If these goods are presented in the form of NFTs, the total commodity value of the virtual world is formed. At the same time, fungible tokens (the game’s native token) should price these commodity values, not be driven by speculation in the real world. Truly good token designs must penetrate into the game to capture value, rather than forming a financial sideline outside the game.

But more than just economics, Abyss World must be a community-driven game. We won’t simply give power to token holders but will invite deeply involved players to participate in dynamic management. Our goal is to create a truly fair and efficient token design that reflects the values and desires of the players who make our world so special.


Look Forward
So why aren’t there any good Web3 games now?

This is due to the fact that creating quality content takes time and cannot be fueled by speculation alone. For Web3 game developers, it’s important to face external doubts and stay true to their vision in order to create compelling gaming experiences.

Our commitment is simple — to create a game that is truly fun and engaging for players, no matter how the market changes. Abyss World is a thrilling adventure that promises to take players on an unforgettable journey.

We are determined to push the boundaries of what’s possible and create a new standard for gaming in the virtual world. So join us on this exciting journey and be a part of the future of gaming.

Abyss World is a great adventure.

We are all pioneers.

Special thanks to Mysten Labs and other supporters, who have been a beacon of light in the midst of a cold winter.

We want to express our heartfelt gratitude to the new members who have joined our community in the past few days!

Today, we will address some of the questions that you have raised.

Why have we disclosed more information about the economic model of the game?
We believe that Web3 game design is not solely about making more money, but rather, it is about distributing profits more fairly and creating content that is made by the community itself. That is why we have made every effort to ensure the fairness of the game so that participants with different demands will not have any significant conflicts.

Ultimately, the value capture of the Abyss World Tokens will depend fully on how large the Abyss World game ecosystem is, such as more active players, their records of exploration, and challenges in the game, which are where the true value lies.

The game mechanics and the roadmap of the white paper will also be gradually disclosed through Medium and Gitbook. The framework has already been designed, and we hope to preserve some surprises for our players.

2. How can we ensure the quality of the game when it only costs 2 million USD so far?

Although 2 million dollars may not be much for big IPs, it is a significant amount of money for an indie-game studio like ours. The founding team has been making the game under difficult circumstances for the past three years, as described in the article written by Max, the game producer.

https://medium.com/@ABYSS_WORLD/from-dreamers-to-pioneers-why-we-create-abyss-world-ecd2ede02431

The quality of a game is not measured by money, but by the revealed actual gameplay. We maximize the use of every bit of funds and invest them all in the development of game quality. A good game can not be measured by the amount of investment alone. Fortunately, the game has received support from IGN, the largest game media platform, and more announcements from companies such as AMD and Microsoft are coming soon.

We regard this as public recognition of the quality of the game.

3. Is there a game demo available?

The game itself has achieved a high level of completion, from the combat system to actual gameplay. And we have already provided test versions to some gaming influencers on a small scale. Of course, the alpha version for players will have to wait, and we will plan to release it in coordination with the Sui Network’s mainnet launch. In the meantime, we will try our best to showcase the rich in-game content we have developed.

4. Does Abyss World have plans to issue NFTs?

We will be announcing our plans in the next few days, so stay tuned.

NFTs that have no gameplay value has no actual worth. The goal we want to explore together is the combinability of NFTs based on gameplay value.

We can promise that Abyss World NFTs will be very different from NFTs of other Web3 games and will have truly sustainable long-term value.

We sincerely value the first batch of NFT holders as real early contributors to Abyss World.

5. What can you do now as an early community member?

As an early contributor, you can help promote our vision or assist in answering some questions and possible misunderstandings. The active players in the community now are comrades exploring the path with us. For active and contributing players, we will directly give NFT rewards based on certain requirements in the future.

Finally, let us share our mission:

The Web3 space bubble can not sustain itself without practical applications. Too many people are working on unverifiable infrastructures, and too few are creating high-quality apps.

Our original intention is to complete a good game that we have in mind and gain recognition and popularity among a group of players who appreciate it.

Once we achieve that, our team’s historical mission will be accomplished, and perhaps Abyss World will become a community-owned project with intrinsic value.



Our Goal

Abyss World is a product driven by pure passion.

Above all else, our team is committed to pouring all our skills and talents into creating a game that is not only complete but polished to perfection.

We are tired of letting VCs and capital determine the direction of the industry in the web3 world. As we have all seen, the consequences of letting them tell the story have resulted in fewer and fewer real-world applications, and projects have turned into piles of speculative bubbles.

As a team with a solid product in the web3 world, our original intention was to create a project in which many people could participate from the beginning.

Abyss World will become the first Web3 AAA game with high maturity driven by the community.

All of our past efforts are worth leaving behind for those who work hard with us.

So let’s be straight:

For those who hold Gazer NFTs as early contributors to Abyss World, we should give you rich rewards.

Abyss World will introduce Gazer NFTs with four levels of rarity in its first release, totaling 2100 NFTs:

There will be 1163 NFTs of R rarity, 582 NFTs of SR rarity, 292 NFTs of SSR rarity, and 63 NFTs of the ultimate SP rarity (SP cannot be minted and can only be obtained through auction).


The utility of Abyss World Gazer NFT is clear:

• Private Test / Open Beta Pass

• Unique Equipment & Accessory Airdrop

• Future Privilege in NFTs & Token Airdrop

Abyss World Token Airdrop: (Claim after Sui Mainnet live)


The holders of this batch of the Gazer NFT series will be airdropped 1% of the Abyss World Native Token ($AWT) total supply. And, of course, not just limited to the $AWT.

…Surprise?


In addition to receiving more token airdrops, the higher-level Gazer NFTs will also grant holders more in-game privileges. A higher level of gaming experience in Abyss World is guaranteed!

In the coming months, there will also be many events, like live streaming of the game content. The first group of people who hold the NFTs and actively participate in all activities before the game launch will be given additional airdrop rewards.

We have enough confidence to ensure that the value of these NFTs will be linked to the great content we ceaselessly create.

Let’s rise from the Abyss to change this Web3 space!

Additional information:

NFTs will be first issued on Ethereum as ERC-721 standard. The rights redemption of NFTs (token airdrop/utility in the game) will be mapped after Sui Mainnet.

The official minting date and the privileges of each rarity will be announced very soon.

As a flagship open-world ARPG game funded by Mysten Labs and launched on the Sui chain, Abyss World will become the best example of community-driven gaming. Abyss World has already received over 70,000 wishlists on Steam and gained recognition from traditional players for its game quality, as well as rewards from Microsoft’s startup program (more news will be announced soon).

Abyss World will undoubtedly become one of the highest-quality gaming content in the Web3 gaming space.

The Gazer NFT mint event is an early benefit for the Abyss World community members, exclusively available for minting on the Abyss World official website very soon.

There will be 1163 NFTs of R rarity, 582 NFTs of SR rarity, 292 NFTs of SSR rarity, and 63 NFTs of the ultimate SP rarity (SP cannot be minted and can only be obtained through auction).


The total amount of the first batch of genesis NFTs for early community members is 2,100, which includes 100 Airdrops, 1000 discounted whitelists, and 1000 regular NFTs.


Abyss World will provide the maximum benefits to NFT holders, including but not limited to:

Passes for private testing/Open Beta testing
Unique in-game weapons and equipment airdrops
$AWT (native token) & $SUI token airdrop

Rarity and Airdrop


Holders of the first batch of the Gazer NFT series will be allocated 1% of the Abyss World native token ($AWT) and will receive it after the IDO.
Holders of each level can receive $SUI airdrops after the Sui mainnet launches.
Opportunity to participate in offline game exhibition testing (coming E3 event)

Q&A

Who can MINT the Gazer NFT?
All users can mint on the official support page:

· Users who are eligible for Airdrops will receive the airdrop within 24 hours.

· Users who have WL (discounted mint), need to mint within 72 hours after the start of the event.

· Users who have no discounts can participate in the minting 24 hours after the start of the event, which lasts for 96 hours (4 days).

2. On which chain will the Gazer NFT series be minted?

The NFTs will be first launched on the Ethereum chain, and the rights redemption of NFTs (token airdrops/practicality in the game) will be mapped after the Sui mainnet online. On the day of minting, users can connect their wallets to the official website to participate in the event. Please prepare enough $ETH (Gas+Mint) in the wallet.

3. What is the specific MINT process?

The user connects the Metamask or WalletConnect wallet to the webpage, clicks the MINT button, and authorizes the payment, and the NFT will be automatically sent to the connected wallet address by the contract.

4. How many NFTs can be minted by one address?

For fairness, each address can only mint 3 NFTs (including Airdrop, Discount Mint(WhiteList), and Regular Mint) at the same time, and can only have one chance for Airdrop and one chance for Discount Mint(WhiteList). For example, if you have one chance for Airdrop and one chance for Discount Mint, the remaining chance can only be used for Regular Mint.

5. Which rarity-level NFTs can be minted with the Discount WhiteList?

The Discount WhiteList can mint NFTs of any rarity level except SP (Auction only). For example, the R rarity level will cost 0.2E*0.7=0.14E, the SR rarity level will cost 0.4E*0.7=0.28E, and the SSR rarity level will cost 0.8E*0.7=0.56E.

6. How to obtain the highest rarity level SP NFTs?

SP NFTs will only be available for auction, and specific rules will be announced after the minting of the first batch of NFTs.(There are 3 SPs for the airdrop.)

7. Can NFTs be traded immediately after minting?

Yes, we will open and connect to the trading markets of Opensea and Blur.


In the upcoming April, we will also have live-streaming events about game content, and the first batch of NFT holders who actively participate in pre-launch activities will have the opportunity to win additional airdrop rewards. We have enough confidence to ensure that the value of these NFTs is continuously linked to our high-quality game content. Let us rise from the abyss and change the Web3 gaming world!

Metagame Industries, an interconnected web3 gaming ecosystem, has partnered with Space and Time, a leader in decentralized data warehousing, to create a new standard in web3 gaming. Space and Time will allow Metagame Industries to store and access vast amounts of game data in the decentralized data platform, where it can be joined with indexed blockchain data.

Metagame Industries is the company behind Abyss World, an open-World Dark Fantasy Action-RPG Web3 title on the Sui Network. By integrating with Space and Time, Abyss World can join indexed blockchain data with off-chain game-generated data in a single query and connect the results back to smart contracts on-chain. This integration enables Abyss World to facilitate more complex earning schemes for in-game economics, run tamper-proof analytics against the game activity, and reduce on-chain storage costs by connecting a scalable decentralized data warehouse to the blockchain-based platform.

“We are thrilled to partner with Space and Time, as their cutting-edge decentralized data warehouse technology will enable us to offer a more efficient and decentralized gaming experience for our players”, said Joe Zu, CEO at Metagame Industries. “By leveraging AI-driven content, we can take Abyss World to the next level and revolutionize the web3 gaming industry.”

More importantly, Abyss World also uses AI algorithms to power various aspects of the game, from NPC behavior to the game’s PvP component, the Abyss Colosseum. To ensure the fairness of the game’s results, Space and Time’s unique architecture allows the AI algorithms for metadata associated with the game’s hero characters to be stored in the decentralized data warehouse, making the core gameplay fully decentralized, ensuring the AI models are verifiable, and enabling the heroes’ perpetual development.

Space and Time’s complete set of developer tools, which includes indexed blockchain data, a hybrid transactional and analytic data warehouse, and a serverless API gateway, provides developers with the necessary infrastructure for developing scalable web3 games.

“Space and Time is committed to the advancement of web3 gaming. Our partnership with Metagame Industries will create a more fair and transparent gaming economy and allow Abyss World to power their game with tamper-proof on-chain and off-chain data and verifiable AI,” said Stephen Hilton, Head of Solutions at Space and Time.

By partnering with Space and Time, Abyss World aims to offer a more decentralized and efficient gaming experience and become a new web3 gaming standard. With the ability to store vast amounts of data in a decentralized and secure way, the possibilities for the game’s evolution are endless. The collaboration between Space and Time and Abyss World promises to revolutionize the web3 gaming industry, offering a more transparent and trustless gaming experience for players.

‘Abyss World’ is the first AAA Open-World Dark Fantasy ARPG built on Sui Network, and is 3 years of indie work by Metagame Industries and being backed by Microsoft, AMD, EPIC & IGN.

Fallen Eye — Utility NFT

The ‘Fallen Eye’ NFTs are tickets to the Abyss Colosseum, an AI-driven BvB Arena, a Bot vs Bot Auto-battler arena driven by AI technology and supported by Space and Time & Microsoft.


‘Fallen Eye’ is also a FREE ticket for early advocates to participate in Abyss World via a week-long live-streaming event starting from April 28th. All participants have the chance to win abundant rewards with a prize pool of up to $250,000.

In Abyss World, BvB is a rich and fun module where players do not directly control their hero characters to battle, but instead cultivate their own team of heroes through daily behaviors in the PvE section. Through AI algorithms, the heroes will have diverse personality traits that can be developed and ultimately exhibit different combat states in the BvB battlefield.

Our intention is to display our team’s ability to develop and design exceptional art in the web3 space, with a combat system that has been perfected.

How to participate? Guess-2-Win

There will be 4 hero characters in the coming event and a total of 6 matches with 5 rounds in each match. The activity will last for 4 days, there will be 2 matches on April 28th, 1 match on April 29th, 1 match on April 30th, and 2 matches on May 1st.

Guessing Website: https://www.abyssworld.games/bet/


1. Players need to guess which hero character will win the most matches out of the six, earning 30 points for guessing the winner correctly. You can guess the winner 24 hours before the activity begins. (If the heroes you guess rank 2nd, you will earn 20 points. If they rank 3rd, you will earn 10 points. However, if they rank last, you will not earn any points.)


2. Additionally, players can also guess which hero will win each individual match, earning 10 points per correct guess, and a maximum of 60 points for all six matches. (Each game will have 5 rounds, one hero who wins 3 rounds will win the game, and if one round is draw, an additional round will be conducted.)


3. The final ranking will be based on each player’s total score, with a maximum of 90 points.


4. All heroes will also have a winning score, earning 10 points for each victory and a maximum of 30 points per hero, if they score the same, another game will be held to decide who is the final winner.


5. Guessing the winning or losing outcome of each game can commence 24 hours before the start of each game, and must conclude before the start of each game.

6. Different amounts of the $AWC prize pool will be allocated based on different points.

7. All Gazer holders have the right to participate and can invite a certain number of players to play for free.

At the same time, the competition results, powered by AI algorithms, will be entirely random.

What Kind of Prizes?

We will distribute the test coin $AWC (Abyss World Credit) from a prize pool of 10 million coins, based on different points earned by players. After $AWT (Abyss World Token) goes live on the SUI mainnet, $AWC can be exchanged at a rate of 10:1 for $AWT from the prize pool of 1 million tokens.

Aside from the potential token rewards, all participants have a chance to win abundant rewards from a prize pool of up to $250,000, including $AWC, IDO WLs, Genesis Gazer NFT Giveaways (with a floor price of 0.35E), and Alpha Test Passes in June.


How to Win Prizes?

1. You can choose to complete relevant tasks on Magic Eden to mint the “Fallen Eye” NFT, or obtain the “Fallen Eye” NFT from other SUI ecological platforms, or obtain them through cooperative communities.

2. After you have minted and acquired the NFT, regardless of whether you hold the NFT obtained from Magic Eden (Polygon) or other platforms or communities(Sui Testnet), you must link your Sui wallet (Ethos or Suiet) to Abyss World’s official website. If you don’t have one, please sign up for your testnet address through these two Sui wallets.


· If you obtain the NFT from Magic Eden(Polygon), you have to connect your Polygon wallet and Sui wallet at the same time to start guessing on the website which is on Sui.

· If you obtain the NFT from Clutchy, TocenLauchpad, Souffl3, Mobius, and BlueMove (Sui Testnet), you need to link your Sui Wallet (Ethos or Suiet) to start guessing on the website which is on Sui.

PS: One address could only mint one NFT.

3. After linking the wallet, please enter our game page, and you can vote for the hero character you like to guess who will win, and the result can not be changed after placing the vote.

4. Players can guess the final winning character and the winning character of each game to obtain points.

5. The final score of each player counted on the leaderboard will serve as the basis for rewards. Different amounts of the $AWC prize pool will be allocated based on different points. You can claim your $AWC after the activity ends.

We aim to change the current state of web3 games with high-quality content and wish all players a pleasant gaming experience!

Preparation Before Guessing:

We provided two types of NFT tickets on multiple platforms, Sui testnet NFT tickets and Polygon-chain NFT tickets.

When you get to the website, please choose the correct channel to verify your NFT tickets.
If you only hold the Polygon NFT, you will need to register a Sui testnet address while connecting a Polygon wallet and a Sui wallet on Abyss World Website to participate in the activity. (You may get the Polygon NFT from Magic Eden or Element)
If you hold the Sui testnet NFT, you can directly connect to the Sui wallet containing the NFT ticket to participate in the activity. (You may get the Sui testnet NFT from TocenLauchpad, Souffl3, Mobius, BlueMove, or other partner communities and KOLs.)
If you are a Gazer Holder, you will need to register a Sui testnet address while connecting an ETH wallet and a Sui wallet on Abyss World Website to participate in the activity. After your Gazer NFTs have been verified, you will get the Fallen Eye tickets in 2 hours.
LeaderBoard will be shown in the Abyss World Discord after the matches.
Attention: An address can only hold one ticket to participate in the event.

PS: If you have multiple tickets, please follow the above rules to distribute these tickets to different addresses.

In addition, regarding Sui Test Tokens, after verifying the participant’s Sui testnet address which holds the NFT (on either polygon or Sui), we will airdrop Sui Test Tokens. But please note that all NFTs and Sui Test Tokens after the airdrop should be confirmed by checking the transaction records on the Sui browser (if Sui wallet is not displaying your NFTs). https://explorer.sui.io/

You will participate in a total of 7 guessing votes — guessing the winning hero in 6 matches and the hero with the most wins.

Each match will start voting 24 hours in advance and close voting before the live stream event begins.
The final vote for the winning hero will start on April 27th, 4PM UTC and close before the first live stream on April 28th.
Attention: One NFT (Ticket) only has 7 chances to guess.

After the Guessing:

We will tally up the final scores for all addresses and distribute the relevant rewards from the prize pool based on the proportion in a couple of days.

The purpose of this live stream guessing game is to expand the Abyss World community through free tickets and showcase the rich and fun content within our game. The AI-driven Cyber Colosseum will be a long-term operating section of Abyss World, and players will still have the opportunity to participate and receive future airdrop rewards, etc., even after this live stream event.


Exciting News to Share！

During the live stream event of Abyss World AI-driven BvB battles, nearly 15,000 addresses voted their favorite heroes based on contracts, and 150,000 interactions were achieved on the Sui testnet. The event itself was an absolutely meaningful journey. We have had 300% growth in the community in less than a month!

We just can’t do this with you! Special thanks to every single member of our robust community!

Remember, every NFT Pass holder and participant in the event will be rewarded!

Below are the rewards for this event:


A total of approximately 26,000 Pass tickets have been distributed for this event. After detailed calculations, 10 million $AWC (Sui testnet) will be airdropped to all addresses that hold Pass NFTs and actively participate in the event.
Any user who holds a Pass NFT can receive 50 $AWC per NFT, and the airdrop quantity can be stacked at the same address based on the number of NFTs held.
Even if you didn’t guess correctly, but voted for your favorite hero, you will still receive more airdrop rewards.
For the rewards of IDO whitelists and Gazer NFTs, we will conduct a lottery for users who scored 90 and 80 points in the next few days. Please stay tuned for notifications.
All of our $AWC tokens are to be distributed today! Please remember to check your wallet for $AWC via Sui Explorer. Thanks again for your support as an early member!

Remember, all $AWC can be swapped to $AWT after TGE. Congratulations in advance on receiving the native token of the game, $AWT!

Attention: We are now taking snapshots of each address. Please do not transfer or trade your NFT for the next 12 hours, as doing so will make you ineligible for rewards.


Dear community members,

All the $AWC has been airdropped to your Sui wallet!

However, as Sui’s testnet will be undergoing maintenance on May 11th, the Sui testnet tokens $AWC, which have already been airdropped, will no longer be usable.

Therefore, after careful internal discussion, our team has decided to release a feature on the Abyss World official website allowing for the exchange of $AWC tokens on the Sui testnet to the Polygon network (evm). This will ensure that everyone’s efforts are accurately and permanently recorded.

The exchange steps are as follows:

Connect your Sui wallet address containing the Sui test tokens.
Connect your Metamask wallet to the Polygon network.
Click “Confirm Exchange” and wait for the $AWC airdrop on your Polygon address (evm).
Special Note:

The Exchange channel will be released in two days!

Moving your $AWC within your Sui wallet will not have any effect, as the airdrop on Polygon will also be exchanged based on today’s final airdrop count.

Again, thank you for the tremendous support from every community member!

There will be more opportunities to earn $AWC this month, so stay cool!

We are excited to share that Abyss World’s Economic Whitepaper has been updated!

You can find the details in Abyss World Economic White Paper.

Now, in particular, we would like to highlight a few updates to the $AWT, the native token of Abyss world.

Increase the total supply of $AWT tokens from 1 billion to 10 billion
The total distributed tokens for Gazer holders have also been increased by a factor of 10, while the percentage remains at 1%. AWC will be exchanged for AWT at the ratio of 1:1 upon TGE.

The reason is rather simple — the increase in a number of tokens is related to our expectations for the game. We have already surpassed 110,000 Steam wishlist players, which is a huge Milestone in the web2 gaming world, let alone in the web3 space. Thus, as a game with the potential to break through the wall between two spaces, our goal is to attract 1 million players. Achieving this level of user engagement requires a correspondingly large circulating supply of tokens.


Steam Wishlists 110K+
2. Increase in-game rewards from 35% to 40%

We believe that Abyss World has the potential to be a fair, community-driven game. We have reduced the private token allocation from 10% to 5% and have allocated the remaining tokens to in-game rewards. This means that more $AWT game tokens will be owned by players who enjoy the game. Additionally, for this closed round, we were very selective about our investors, only working with institutions that truly believe in our game content and are willing to wait for long-term rewards.

3. New $AWT token burning mechanism

Essentially, Abyss World will be a free-to-play live service game that generates revenue from in-game transactions and sales of skins, consumables, etc. 20% of the global revenue generated each quarter will be bought back to burn $AWT tokens.

In addition, $AWT will be used and burned as the “raw material” for Asset-based NFTs that generate in-game cash flow (for details refer to the economic white paper).

This will not only lead to true “deflation” from an economic perspective but also bind the value of $AWT tokens to the value of in-game assets and commodities. The more players create in-game props and assets, the more valuable $AWT tokens become.


Token Allocation
With the upcoming IDO, we hope that everyone can join forces with Abyss World to create a high-quality community-driven game where there is no gap between web2 and web3, but only passionate players and future residents of the Metaverse.


Abyss World is gearing up for the launch of its IDO!

To ensure greater user participation in our event, we have organized an exciting Invite Contest. This contest aims to enhance community engagement and offer attractive rewards to participants, and will be concluded with a BvB live stream event (guess to win). By completing specific tasks and taking part in designated activities, users will have the opportunity to earn $AWC and secure a spot on the IDO whitelist, granting them a 20% discount to purchase 100U.

Detailed Rules


When you visit the website, you should log in with your Discord Account first.
After logging in, you can Check-In every single day to earn 5 $AWC. (You can keep Checking In to earn $AWC after the Invite Contest Ends.)
Once checked in, you can finish the social quests to get $AWC, such as Following Twitter and Joining Abyss World Discord. You can get 25 $AWC after finishing each quest.
When you finish the social quests, you can generate your own invite link to invite your friends to the website to join the activity. (Only when you finish the social quests you can generate the invite link.)
Note 1: People can get 10 $AWC for each new referral. Moreover, if you invite 5, 10, 25, and 100 people, you will get an additional 50, 150, 400, and 2000 $AWC respectively (e.g., If a user invites 10 people, he/she should get 10x10 + 50+150 = 300 $AWC).

Note 2: People who invite 10, 60, and 150 friends will get 1 whitelist for 100U, 3 whitelists for 100U, and 5 whitelists for 100U respectively. For example, if a user invites 150 people, he/she can get 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 whitelists.

Attention: The whitelist is a 20% discount coupon for which you can buy 100U $AWT when IDO and is limited in quantity.

Remember: First come, first served!

We will announce how to claim your AWC tokens and the IDO whitelist before the start of the IDO. Please stay tuned for further updates.

If there are a large number of uncontrollable sybil attacks, we will take measures to ban them.

Thank you to all the Gazer Holders for your continued attention and support. Thank you for your patience and we will also announce the release ratio and total release amount of Sui token and $AWT soon. Below are the detailed data:

Detailed Rules:
Whitelist:

Each whitelist spot allows the purchase of $100 tokens at a discounted price of 20%, resulting in an equivalent asset value of $125 after contribution. Pay $100 and receive $125 tokens.
Discount always guaranteed before the IDO ends.
Multiple whitelists can be accumulated in one address, and users will be able to see their remaining whitelist quantity, without the need to use them all at once.
Any amount exceeding the whitelist quota will be calculated at the original price.
Fundraising Limit Rules:

The opening price of $AWT is $0.003 per $AWT token. Within the fundraising range of 0% to 100%, the price will remain at $0.003 per $AWT token. Any unsold portion of the 500 million $AWT tokens will be burned by sending to a black hole address after the IDO is completed.

Once the initial fundraising limit of 100% is exceeded, the price of $AWT will fluctuate based on the total fundraising amount. The number of tokens users receive will be divided proportionally based on their personal equivalent contribution and the total fundraising amount, considering the total supply of 500 million $AWT tokens.

Any amount exceeding the total fundraising limit of 500% will be refunded after the IDO ends. This means that the hard cap for the IDO is set at 500%.

For example, let’s say that the user Tom has 4 whitelists and has contributed $500 to the IDO allocation.

In this case, his equivalent value would be calculated as follows:
4 * 100 / 0.8 + 100 = $600.

Assuming that the total fundraising pool at the end of the IDO represents 80% of the total fundraising amount, which is $1.2 million, the formula to calculate the number of tokens he will receive after the IDO ends are:

600 USD / 0.003 USD/AWT = 200,000 AWT.

Alternatively, if the total fundraising pool at the end of the IDO represents 200% of the total fundraising amount, which is $3 million, the formula to calculate the number of tokens he will receive after the IDO ends are:

600 USD / 3,000,000 USD * 500 million (total AWT supply) = 100,000 AWT.

The price of AWT tokens will not change until the initial fundraising goal is reached. Within the range of fundraising from 100% to 500%, the total token supply is evenly distributed among the total fundraising pool. Any amount exceeding 500% will not be considered, and the excess will be refunded after the IDO ends.

If fundraising exceeds the limit of 500% during the IDO, the specific token quantity displayed on the website may increase after the IDO ends. This is because that any funds raised beyond the 500% limit will be refunded to the payment address, resulting in an increase in the token assets of other users.

Eventually, you can see how many tokens you will receive and your current asset percentage on the website. This number may be updated in real-time during the IDO and will be finalized after the IDO ends or reaches the hard cap.

Details worth paying attention to:
Please make sure you understand the public sale mechanics and terms before proceeding. Deposited amounts CANNOT be withdrawn. However, any funds raised beyond our predefined hard cap of 500% times the initial target（1.5M$） will be refunded after the sale concludes, and those contributions will not receive $AWT tokens.

Initially, the auction will start with a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $30M, fixing a $0.003 floor price for $AWT, and will increase after the first $1.5M has been raised.

Once the $1.5M target is reached, a price-discovery phase will be reached, where the token price will continuously increase at every contribution.
Once the total raised amount reaches 500% times the initial target, the price of AWT will stop increasing, and any additional funds raised will be refunded. In other words, the 500% mark represents the hard cap of the total fund pool.

Remember: whenever you participate, you will get $AWT tokens at the same price with others.

You can contribute with USDT in exchange for $AWT tokens.
The release of AWT tokens will be divided into batches according to a specific release schedule.

The tokens you receive will have the exact same $value as your contribution.

As 500,000,000 $AWT (of a 10,000,000,000 total supply) will be allocated to the sale, the final price will therefore be: Total $ raised / 500,000,000 AWT

What To Expect？
This IDO is not just about the Abyss World project, but about each individual seeking a second chance in the Web3 field.

We have weathered the industry’s darkness over the past two years, still yearning for the light.

With the Abyss World community, we can march confidently toward the brightness ahead.

Embark with Abyss World on the most adventurous ship in the Web3 world.

You will never be alone again.

On June 1st, during our IDO event, we experienced a series of Zero-Value Token Transfer Attacks targeting our blockchain funds. As a security measure, we have deployed an automated transfer script that automatically transfers funds to the project team’s Binance address every 500,000 tokens.

However, IDO funds and your assets are SAFE, and your wallet private key has NOT been compromised.

We sincerely want to alert you that hackers have targeted all addresses involved in our interactions. As a result, there is a possibility of receiving false USDT tokens in your wallet, especially after participating in the IDO event. To ensure the safety of your funds, please carefully verify the address before making any transfers and avoid falling victim to this type of attack.

Below is the details for the Zero-Value Token Transfer Attack:

Hackers launched an attack on IDO address as well as IDO participant addresses.

0x970f720587727c06bcb50931bc110f6b258e2635285a75c146a01350fc76e707
This is an attack on the IDO address, which has been flagged by polygonscan

2. 0x1d73f568f71605cbd72e62dcf8dbbae8c731d1d6

This is an attack on the IDO participant address.

Beware of fraudulent addresses! Hackers are generating fake addresses similar to the IDO address to launch attacks. Double-check before transferring funds to avoid falling victim to this scam.

We are committed to long-term development with heartfelt sincerity, placing the community at the core of our values. We firmly believe that only through close collaboration with the community, listening to their voices, and addressing their needs, can we achieve sustainable growth and prosperity.

Listing & TGE

We are thrilled to announce that Abyss World Token — $AWT will have its initial launch on the Bitget exchange on June 12th, followed by a listing on Mexc on the same day. The specific timing will be subject to official announcements from the exchanges.

Amid the recent uncertainties surrounding the Sui ecosystem project, we have engaged in discussions with several exchanges. However, we cannot accept certain unfair terms and potential risks. Therefore, we have conducted careful evaluation and selection. Bitget exchange has shown tremendous support for the Abyss World project, providing ample liquidity to ensure deep trading for our users. Furthermore, it can be confirmed that collaborations with other leading exchanges will be initiated as the project progresses. We will approach these partnerships with a commitment to fairness and equality.

$AWC & $AWT

The first batch of 10% of tokens unlocked in the public sale will be directly airdropped to the users’ participating Polygon addresses in the IDO before the initial listing. The remaining tokens can be claimed by users following the release schedule on the official website.
For users who receive $AWC airdrop rewards, the $AWC to $AWT conversion website will go live on June 12th, allowing users to choose a 1:1 conversion rate to exchange their $AWC for $AWT. The $AWC used for conversion will be sent to a black hole address for burning.
For winners of the IDO Rush event, $AWT tokens will be airdropped to the Zealy event-related addresses on the day of listing. Users with any inquiries about the winners’ list are advised to carefully review the event’s victory rules or patiently wait for manual processing on the official Discord.
For Gazer holders, the official team will open the claim portal before listing. Users will be able to input their Ethereum addresses holding Gazer NFTs and their personal Sui addresses through a web link. After verification, the corresponding amount of $AWT and $SUI will be automatically distributed within the specified timeframe. During this period, please refrain from trading Gazer NFTs to avoid potential issues with the airdrop.
For more details and specific timing, please stay tuned for future official announcements.
