We greatly appreciate your support and patience. It is with immense excitement that we unveil the Alpha Test (Phase 1) of our project. This highly anticipated test will span over 5 days, commencing on July 3rd and concluding on July 8th, at 12 PM UTC time.

The objective of this test is to invite our Gazer holders and our early supporters who get our Alpha Test Game Pass to participate and test our game version, providing valuable feedback and experiencing the journey in advance. Through this test, we aim to further refine the game’s mechanics and functionalities.

Participants in the test will have the opportunity to earn abundant rewarding prizes.

Abyss Test Medal
Firstly, we will provide a Test Medal as an in-game reward to acknowledge your participation and contribution to the testing. This Test Medal is a symbol that you have completed all the content in the Alpha Test.
Rare Chests (Golden) NFT
Additionally, we will offer Rare Chests (Golden) containing precious in-game items and rewards upon the Full Version of Abyss World. Anyone who has joined the Alpha Test (Phase 1) and has completed the game will receive the rewards. The Rare Chests will be airdropped to you within 48 hours after the conclusion of the Alpha Test Phase 1. After the game’s official launch, you will have the opportunity to purchase keys to open the chests and obtain valuable in-game items.

Token Rewards — $AWT
As an incentive for participation, ALL players who successfully complete the game will receive a participation reward of 1,000 $AWT each.

Furthermore, we will introduce a leaderboard mechanism to track users’ game completion time. (The time is your Game Completion Time, if you do not complete the game, you will not be on the leaderboard.)

On July 9th, we will announce the top 30 players with the shortest game completion time.

Here are the rewards for these 30 players:

The first-place winner will receive a reward of 200,000 AWT.
