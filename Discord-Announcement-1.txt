"MYSTEN LABS x ABYSS WORLD AMA WINNERS: We had an amazing AMA with MYSTEN LABS yesterday. Here's the list of winners from the AMA event. Congratulations to all the lucky participants! Stay tuned for more exciting events!" (Page 19)

"MYSTEN LABS x ABYSS WORLD AMA RECAP: Wondering why ABYSS WORLD is building on the Sui Blockchain? Here are some of the reasons shared on the AMA: Among all public chains, Sui Ecology provides the most grounded technical support for game creators at the underlying level. Sui will spare no effort in supporting quality games to enter the ecosystem, positioning itself as a game-focused public chain rather than trying to do everything. The efficiency of the public chain has been demonstrated on the devnet by the current mainstream games in the ecosystem, such as Abyss World and Cosmocadia. Technically, Abyss World will feature innovative AI usage. In-game hero characters will shape their personalities based on AI algorithms during daily activities, further affecting their combat capabilities. In terms of market strategy, Abyss World will focus on attracting web2 players and converting them into web3 users. At GDC, a significant number of games were observed transitioning to web3 gaming."
