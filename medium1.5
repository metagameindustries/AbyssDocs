"Abyss World is a game developed by MetaGame Industries. Players embark on a journey through the world of Nordinia to uncover the secrets of the missing 'old tide' and restore balance to the world. They collect soul fragments to summon heroic souls with unique abilities to fight against the dark forces of the Abyss. The game features quests and adventures in the Shattered Lands." (Page 1)

"Our goal is to create a truly fair and efficient token design that reflects the values and desires of the players who make our world so special. Abyss World is a thrilling adventure that promises to take players on an unforgettable journey. We are determined to push the boundaries of what’s possible and create a new standard for gaming in the virtual world." (Page 3)

"To participate in the test, please ensure that you are a Gazer holder or you have our Alpha Test Game Pass. If you want to win the rewards, you have to complete the game during the Alpha Test (Phase 1). Your account will be bound with one email address. Each Gazer NFT or Game Pass can only be associated with one account." (Page 29)

"After careful internal discussion, our team has decided to release a feature on the Abyss World official website allowing for the exchange of $AWC tokens on the Sui testnet to the Polygon network (evm). This will ensure that everyone’s efforts are accurately and permanently recorded." (Page 17)

"Abyss World is gearing up for the launch of its IDO! To ensure greater user participation in our event, we have organized an exciting Invite Contest. This contest aims to enhance community engagement and offer attractive rewards to participants, and will be concluded with a BvB live stream event (guess to win). By completing specific tasks and taking part in designated activities, users will have the opportunity to earn $AWC and secure a spot on the IDO whitelist, granting them a 20% discount to purchase 100U." (Page 19)

"In your Territory, you can improve the basic combat effectiveness and stats of your Heroes by crafting legendary equipment for them. This will require farming materials in the Shattered Lands, so be sure to explore and gather as much as you can. As you and your fellow summoners explore the magnificent fantasy world that was once destroyed, you will have the opportunity to exchange resources and form your dream team of powerful warriors." (Page 1)

"For Web3 game developers, it’s important to face external doubts and stay true to their vision in order to create compelling gaming experiences. Our commitment is to create a game that is truly fun and engaging for players, no matter how the market changes." (Page 3)

"During the live stream event of Abyss World AI-driven BvB battles, nearly 15,000 addresses voted their favorite heroes based on contracts, and 150,000 interactions were achieved on the Sui testnet. The event itself was an absolutely meaningful journey. We have had 300% growth in the community in less than a month!" (Page 15)

"We believe that Web3 game design is not solely about making more money, but rather, it is about distributing profits more fairly and creating content that is made by the community itself. That is why we have made every effort to ensure the fairness of the game so that participants with different demands will not have any significant conflicts." (Page 4)

"The game mechanics and the roadmap of the white paper will also be gradually disclosed through Medium and Gitbook. The framework has already been designed, and we hope to preserve some surprises for our players." (Page 4)

"The game itself has achieved a high level of completion, from the combat system to actual gameplay. And we have already provided test versions to some gaming influencers on a small scale. Of course, the alpha version for players will have to wait, and we will plan to release it in coordination with the Sui Network’s mainnet launch." (Page 4)

"One address could only mint one NFT. After linking the wallet, please enter our game page, and you can vote for the hero character you like to guess who will win, and the result cannot be changed after placing the vote. Players can guess the final winning character and the winning character of each game to obtain points. The final score of each player counted on the leaderboard will serve as the basis for rewards. Different amounts of the $AWC prize pool will be allocated based on different points. You can claim your $AWC after the activity ends." (Page 13)

"To participate in the test, please ensure that you are a Gazer holder or you have our Alpha Test Game Pass. If you want to win the rewards, you have to complete the game during the Alpha Test (Phase 1). Your account will be bound with one email address. Each Gazer NFT or Game Pass can only be associated with one account. (One NFT binds with one email address.) If you trade or transfer your NFT after you have created the account, your current account will be blocked." (Page 29)

"We can promise that Abyss World NFTs will be very different from NFTs of other Web3 games and will have truly sustainable long-term value. We sincerely value the first batch of NFT holders as real early contributors to Abyss World. For active and contributing players, we will directly give NFT rewards based on certain requirements in the future." (Page 5)

"Abyss World will introduce Gazer NFTs with four levels of rarity in its first release, totaling 2100 NFTs: There will be 1163 NFTs of R rarity, 582 NFTs of SR rarity, 292 NFTs of SSR rarity, and 63 NFTs of the ultimate SP rarity (SP cannot be minted and can only be obtained through auction). The utility of Abyss World Gazer NFT is clear: Private Test / Open Beta Pass, Unique Equipment & Accessory Airdrop, Future Privilege in NFTs & Token Airdrop. The holders of this batch of the Gazer NFT series will be airdropped 1% of the Abyss World Native Token ($AWT) total supply. And, of course, not just limited to the $AWT." (Page 6)

"All participants will be able to share their experiential suggestions for the test in that channel. We will then establish an AWT Reward Pool to recognize and reward players who bring constructive suggestions and contribute to the game. Get ready to showcase your gaming skills and adventurous spirit as we explore a new gaming world!" (Page 29)

"The purpose of this live stream guessing game is to expand the Abyss World community through free tickets and showcase the rich and fun content within our game. The AI-driven Cyber Colosseum will be a long-term operating section of Abyss World, and players will still have the opportunity to participate and receive future airdrop rewards, etc., even after this live stream event." (Page 15)

"We encountered countless detours and setbacks, from the combat system to gameplay design. We overturned countless plans and made continuous attempts and errors. It was a grueling process, and we poured our hearts and souls into it." (Page 2)

"The game itself has achieved a high level of completion, from the combat system to actual gameplay. And we have already provided test versions to some gaming influencers on a small scale. Of course, the alpha version for players will have to wait, and we will plan to release it in coordination with the Sui Network’s mainnet launch.

"The quality of a game is not measured by money, but by the revealed actual gameplay. We maximize the use of every bit of funds and invest them all in the development of game quality. A good game can not be measured by the amount of investment alone. Fortunately, the game has received support from IGN, the largest game media platform, and more announcements from companies such as AMD and Microsoft are coming soon." (Page 4)

"As an early contributor, you can help promote our vision or assist in answering some questions and possible misunderstandings. The active players in the community now are comrades exploring the path with us. For active and contributing players, we will directly give NFT rewards based on certain requirements in the future." (Page 5)

"This IDO is not just about the Abyss World project, but about each individual seeking a second chance in the Web3 field.

"IDO allocation. In this case, his equivalent value would be calculated as follows: 4 * 100 / 0.8 + 100 = $600. Assuming that the total fundraising pool at the end of the IDO represents 80% of the total fundraising amount, which is $1.2 million, the formula to calculate the number of tokens he will receive after the IDO ends are: 600 USD / 0.003 USD/AWT = 200,000 AWT. Alternatively, if the total fundraising pool at the end of the IDO represents 200% of the total fundraising amount, which is $3 million, the formula to calculate the number of tokens he will receive after the IDO ends are: 600 USD / 3,000,000 USD * 500 million (total AWT supply) = 100,000 AWT." (Page 23)

"The tokens you receive will have the exact same $value as your contribution. As 500,000,000 $AWT (of a 10,000,000,000 total supply) will be allocated to the sale, the final price will therefore be: Total $ raised / 500,000,000 AWT." (Page 24)

"The first batch of 10% of tokens unlocked in the public sale will be directly airdropped to the users’ participating Polygon addresses in the IDO before the initial listing. The remaining tokens can be claimed by users following the release schedule on the official website. For users who receive $AWC airdrop rewards, the $AWC to $AWT conversion website will go live on June 12th, allowing users to choose a 1:1 conversion rate to exchange their $AWC for $AWT." (Page 26)

"Abyss World just officially passed its token smart contract audit by @MoveBit_, the top 1 audit firm focusing on Move ecosystem projects. Upon the release of our content, we will continue our efforts to cater to the expanding community of users." (Page 26)

"We encountered countless detours and setbacks, from the combat system to gameplay design. We overturned countless plans and made continuous attempts and errors. It was a grueling process, and we poured our hearts and souls into it. In order to create a successful ARPG game, it’s crucial to have a well-established brand and a significant amount of financial resources to devote to trial and error. The development process can take years and involves substantial risks. Unfortunately, for smaller studios, the creation of a full-fledged ARPG game can be a nearly insurmountable challenge." (Page 2)

"It took us two long years to complete the game’s core combat system and system infrastructure, and we almost emptied our wallets in the process. But we refused to give up, and in 2023, we finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. We met people who believed in our vision and were willing to support us in the long run. It was a humbling and inspiring experience, and it taught us that with passion and perseverance, anything is possible." (Page 2)

"As a passionate player of games such as Dota, Darkness, God of War, and World of Warcraft, I understand firsthand the deep connection that players can develop with these virtual worlds. The devastating impact that server shutdowns, like the recent closure of the Blizzard server, can have on players is huge. When a server is shut down or data is deleted by the operators, it’s not just a game that’s being lost. For many players, their entire virtual existence is erased. All the hours, days, and weeks they spent building characters, exploring new worlds, and forging relationships with other players are wiped away. This can be an incredibly emotional experience, akin to losing a treasured possession or even a part of oneself." (Page 2)

It took us two long years to complete the game’s core combat system and system infrastructure, and we almost emptied our wallets in the process. But we refused to give up, and in 2023, we finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. We met people who believed in our vision and were willing to support us in the long run. It was a humbling and inspiring experience, and it taught us that with passion and perseverance, anything is possible." (Page 2)

"The game itself has achieved a high level of completion, from the combat system to actual gameplay. And we have already provided test versions to some gaming influencers on a small scale. Of course, the alpha version for players will have to wait, and we will plan to release it in coordination with the Sui Network’s mainnet launch. In the meantime, we will try our best to showcase the rich in-game content we have developed." (Page 4)

"We are committed to long-term development with heartfelt sincerity, placing the community at the core of our values. We firmly believe that only through close collaboration with the community, listening to their voices, and addressing their needs, can we achieve sustainable growth and prosperity." (Page 25)

"Although 2 million dollars may not be much for big IPs, it is a significant amount of money for an indie-game studio like ours. The founding team has been making the game under difficult circumstances for the past three years, as described in the article written by Max, the game producer. The quality of a game is not measured by money, but by the revealed actual gameplay. We maximize the use of every bit of funds and invest them all in the development of game quality. A good game can not be measured by the amount of investment alone. Fortunately, the game has received support from IGN, the largest game media platform, and more announcements from companies such as AMD and Microsoft are coming soon." (Page 4)

"The purpose of this live stream guessing game is to expand the Abyss World community through free tickets and showcase the rich and fun content within our game. The AI-driven Cyber Colosseum will be a long-term operating section of Abyss World, and players will still have the opportunity to participate and receive future airdrop rewards, etc., even after this live stream event." (Page 15)

"We are excited to share that Abyss World’s Economic Whitepaper has been updated! You can find the details in Abyss World Economic White Paper." (Page 17)

"The tokens you receive will have the exact same $value as your contribution. As 500,000,000 $AWT (of a 10,000,000,000 total supply) will be allocated to the sale, the final price will therefore be: Total $ raised / 500,000,000 AWT. This IDO is not just about the Abyss World project, but about each individual seeking a second chance in the Web3 field. We have weathered the industry’s darkness over the past two years, still yearning for the light. With the Abyss World community, we can march confidently toward the brightness ahead." (Page 24)

"Discord. All participants will be able to share their experiential suggestions for the test in that channel. We will then establish an AWT Reward Pool to recognize and reward players who bring constructive suggestions and contribute to the game. Get ready to showcase your gaming skills and adventurous spirit as we explore a new gaming world!" (Page 29)
